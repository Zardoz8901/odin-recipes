            <li>1 1/2 quarts peanut, vegetable, or canola oil</li>
            <li>16 fresh corn tortillas, stacked in groups of 8 and cut into 6 wedges each</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups Nacho Cheese Sauce (1 full recipe), flavored with 2 minced pickled jalapeños</li>
            <li>2 cups refried beans (1/2 recipe), thinned with water to a just-pourable consistency</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sliced pickled jalapeños</li>
            <li>1/2 cup cooked black beans from one (15-ounce) can, drained and rinsed</li>
            <li>8 ounces cheddar and/or Monterey Jack cheese, grated</li>
            <li>2 cups pico de gallo</li>
            <li>1/4 cup Mexican crema</li>
            <li>1/4 cup cojita cheese</li>
            <li>1/4 cup picked cilantro leaves</li>
            <li>1 large radish, very thinly sliced on a mandoline</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sour cream</li>
            <li>1/2 recipe The Best Basic Guacamole</li>
        </ul>

    <h4 class="header">Instructions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 375°F. Heat oil in a large wok or Dutch oven to 350°F. Add 1/3 of tortilla chips and cook, agitating and flipping them constantly with a wire mesh spider until bubbles slow to a trickle and chips are pale golden brown, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined bowl, season with salt, and toss. Allow to drain for 30 seconds, then transfer to a second bowl. Repeat with remaining chips in two more batches.</li>
            <li>Layer 1/2 of chips in the bottom of a rimmed 9-by-13-inch baking sheet or baking dish, leaving a large space in the center. Drizzle with 1/2 of cheese sauce and 1/2 of refried beans. Top with 1/2 sliced pickled jalapeños and 1/2 black beans and sprinkle with 1/2 grated cheese.</li>
            <li>Layer with remaining 1/2 of chips, maintaining the space in the center. Drizzle with remaining cheese sauce and refried beans. Top with remaining jalapeños and black beans and sprinkle all over with remaining grated cheese. Bake until grated cheese is completely melted, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Top with pico de gallo and drizzle all over with crema. Sprinkle cotija on top and garnish with cilantro leaves and radish slices. Mound sour cream and guacamole side-by-side in the space in the center of chips. Serve right away.</li>
        </ol>
